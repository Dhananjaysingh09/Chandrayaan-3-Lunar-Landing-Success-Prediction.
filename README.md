Welcome to the documentation for the "Chandrayaan-3 Lunar Landing Success Prediction" project. In this project, we aim to utilize advanced machine learning techniques to predict the success of the Chandrayaan-3 lunar landing mission. This Read Me file serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the project's objectives, methodologies, and key findings.

Project Overview:
Chandrayaan-3, India's upcoming lunar exploration mission, has garnered significant attention. The primary focus of this project is to leverage historical data from previous lunar missions, including Chandrayaan-1 and Chandrayaan-2, to build a predictive model for the success of the Chandrayaan-3 landing. By harnessing machine learning algorithms, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that can aid in assessing mission outcomes.

Methodology:

1) Data Collection: We compiled data from Chandrayaan-1 and Chandrayaan-2 missions, encompassing a range of variables such as trajectory, communication status, propulsion system performance, and more.

2) Data Preprocessing: To ensure quality and consistency, we cleaned and preprocessed the data, handling missing values and outliers appropriately.

3) Feature Engineering: Relevant features were extracted and engineered from the raw data, aiming to capture mission-specific characteristics and patterns.

4) Model Selection: Several machine learning models were evaluated, including decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, to determine the most effective model for success prediction.

5) Training and Validation: The dataset was divided into training and validation sets to train the model and assess its predictive capabilities accurately.

6) Model Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to evaluate the model's performance and its ability to differentiate successful landings from unsuccessful ones.

Key Findings:
Through rigorous analysis and experimentation, we observed the following key findings:

1) Certain mission parameters exhibit a strong correlation with successful landings.
2) Feature importance analysis revealed critical factors influencing mission success.
3) The selected machine learning model showcases promising predictive accuracy.
